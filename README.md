# sudoJoe
A Zero-Knowledge Server-Client Sudoko Application
- Implemented the whole Zero-Knowledge Sudoku technique where the prover proves to the verifier that he knows the solution to the current game without revealing anything from the solution
- Made the prove non-interactive using the Fiat-Shamir technique inspired from this repo [url](https://github.com/naure/zk)
- Used the Coloring Cryptographic Protocol in this sudoku paper [url](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/%7Enaor/PAPERS/sudoku_abs.html)
